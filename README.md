# Extraction of Argumentative Elements from Text

## About / Synopsis

* Argumentation mining is a research field in Natural Language Processing. The objective is to
  automatically extract and identify argumentative structures from a natural language text. This project provides notebooks aiming to solve that task.
* Project status: Completed
* This project was presented at INSAT university as end of year project.


## How to run it?

* You can run it with google colab plateform by click its icon on the notebook. Note: we recommend using GPU for faster proceessing.
* You can also run them local with jupyter but you need to pay attention to the diffrent packages and requirements.

## Usage

### Features

As highlighted in the above image the task is solved using that pipeline :
* Argument detection phase.
* Argument Classification phase.

The notebooks showcase various NLP ecniques that were used on the embedding level as well as the model.
Word2Vec, Fastext, RNNs, CNNs, Naive Bayes to name a few.

### Limitations

* Due to hardware limitations we couldn't run complex models such as Transfers namely Bert.
* Due to time constraints we didn't finish the deployement phase, we focused all of our efforts on building rebost models.
